# Shell-Search
üê¢ Quickly search google and open your browser window from the command line.

## Motivation
I am currently learning Javascript and always seem to be having to google how to do something while working in the terminal. I thought it would be a good idea to create a small command line program that will open up google with your query.

## Installation
### NPM
```bash
npm install -g Shell-Search
```
### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sam-Lane/Shell-Search.git

cd Shell-Search

npm install -g .
```

## Useage
Simple type your query after the search command in the terminal to trigger a search.

Shell-Search will open with your default system brower.

```bash
search hello world
```


## Testing
```bash
npm test
```
